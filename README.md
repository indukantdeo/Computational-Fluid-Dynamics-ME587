# Computational Fluid Dynamics (ME587)

This repository contains coursework material for the course **Computational Fluid Dynamics (ME587)**.  The primary file in this repository is `Assignment 3.ipynb`, a Jupyter notebook exploring numerical schemes and stability analysis used in CFD.

## Contents

- `Assignment 3.ipynb` – notebook with solutions to three problems covering Adams–Bashforth time stepping, upwind flux discretisation, and related analyses.  The notebook uses `numpy`, `matplotlib` and `sympy` for calculations and plotting.
- `no` – small text file left from the original upload; it has no effect on the notebook.

## Usage

1. Install Jupyter and the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib sympy jupyter
   ```

2. Start Jupyter and open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Assignment 3.ipynb"
   ```

3. Run the notebook cells to reproduce the calculations and figures.

The notebook was originally created with a Python 2 kernel, but the code is compatible with modern Python versions.
